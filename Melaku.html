						<h3>MY STORY</h3>
					<p>I was born on George Washington's birthday (February 22nd), in George Washington Hospital, in Washington D.C., I cannot tell a lie! I am 25 years old, and I am Ethiopian by blood. My name, <em>Melaku Belay</em>, means Arch Angel, and derives from an ancient language known as <em>Ge'ez</em>. Both of my parents came to this country at an early age. Their hard work and grit taught me the importance of having a dream and doing anything to achieve it. </p>
					<p>I've had ideas of becoming a web developer for some time, but it wasn't until a year ago, that I knew THIS was the path for me. I joined a year long I.T. and career readiness program called Year Up that helped uncover my interests which lead to my passion. With the luck of some General Assembly visitors to the site, I heard about the awesome Web Developer Immersive course, and that is how I am here before you today! </p>
					<p>Like my parents, I too am a dreamer and a visionary, and hope to one day share my ideas with the world.. </p>

						<h3>MY PASSIONS</h3>
						<p>I love to create! I love to make art, write peoms, and take still shots to capture brief moments in this journey called life. I also like to solve problems and find better ways to a solution. I like to think of myself as a right and left brain thinker. </p>
						<p>Technology truly drives this planet, and the idea of me jumping into the world of a developer, amazes me! This is a fast, growing and ever evolving field, where I can thrive and be rightfully pushed so. </p>
						<p>Developers are in a sense, creators, helping to build and bring ideas to life. We affect how people interact with information and ultimately each other. The ability to create and develop is a natural gift in life, and the parallels with this career path are not by chance! </p>

						<h3>MY VISION</h3>
					<p>I saw first hand the life of an immigrant, and even had the chance to travel to Africa to visit where my family came from. There are many places in Africa, and even the world today, that are a stark contrast to what I knew saw in America. Seeing the struggles of people, and the challenges that certain places on the planet face, ignited a desire within me. </p>
					<p>As a kid, I knew I wanted to help change this planet and help to defeat many of the problems we face today. It is very important to push yourself, because there are people you don't even know that are counting on you. </p>
					<p>When you know more, you can do more. These words guide my life and help remind me of my WHY. Becuase if I can affect just one person's life, then I've done my part in helping to utilize this powerful force we call change.. </p>
